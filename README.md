# caesar_cipher
Part of the Odin Project Javascript Curriculum

The task: create an encrytion functionality that will shift the original text by the factor specified. Negative numbers should work. Anything that is not letters should be ignored. Capitalization should be preserved. Once the end of the alphabet is reached, the encryption should wrap around.

I added error handling, for example in the case that a letter is entered as a shift factor. Included also is functionality that resets the form. Linting is included.
